# Repository to store sample Python programs.

This repository is meant for beginners to assist them in their learning of Python. The repository covers a wide range of algorithms and other programs, and would prove immensely helpful for everybody interested in Python programming.

If this is your first time coding in Python, I would love to suggest you begin from the [Basics](https://github.com/codebasics/py/tree/master/Basics). They are simple to understand and hopefully will prove fun to you.


Contributions to the repository are welcome.
#### Happy coding!
